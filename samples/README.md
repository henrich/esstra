# ESSTRA Samples

This directory is for samples that show how to use ESSTRA.

Each sample is located in each subdirectory.  See the documentation and the
code in the subdirectory for more information about the samples.

Build and install ESSTRA Core and ESSTRA Utility according to
[README.md](../README.md) in the top directory in advance.

Currently there is one sample [`sample1`](./sample1/README.md).
We plan to expand samples in the future.
